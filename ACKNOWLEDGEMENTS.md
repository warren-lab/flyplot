## Additional Libraries:
- **find_fly_angle**: [find_fly_angle](https://github.com/willdickson/find_fly_angle)
    - The find_fly_angle package was utilized as part of our internal magnotether control software. In the case of `flyplot`, this package was utilized to recalculate the angle of the fly within the MSE-based approach, aiding in determining the proper orientation.
    - Additionally, the base module of `find_fly_angle` was adapted to enhace the accessibility of information and for integration into our workflow.
    - `find_fly_anglev2` is a module within a forked version of `find_fly_angle` with a couple of edits.
