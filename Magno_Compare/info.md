# Magnotether Experimental Comparison Between Looping and Static LED

This directory contains the jupyter notebook `magno_compare.ipynb` that can be used for the comparison of various experiments between Looping and Static LED Magnotether experiments for Drosophila.

This notebook aims to provide relevant figures and statistics. 

There is a supplemental notebook that provided the relevant methods for examining images of Drosophila themselves

FUTURE:

The goal is that the user will be able to run a script to generate a new copy of the base notebook based on the parameters of the experiment they are looking at. This will then create a new sub directory with a fresh working notebook, emtpy data folder, and empty figure and imgs folder. The user will then be able to import their own relevant data into the necessary portions and then run the notebook to see the results.
